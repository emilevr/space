//! Space may be the final frontier, but it sure is annoying when you run out. ðŸ––
//!
//! This library can be used to analyze disk space usage, in one or more directory trees.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! The *space-rs* library provides an efficient way to read one or more directory trees and the apparent
//! size of the contained files. See the [directory_item][`DirectoryItem`] struct.
//!
//! > **NOTE:** The *apparent size* of a file is the size of the file content in bytes, which is typically
//! > slighly less than the actual space based on allocated blocks on the disk. The larger the file the less
//! > significant the difference.
//!
//! > **NOTE:** Symbolic links will be listed but not followed.
